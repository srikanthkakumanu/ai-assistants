I want to build a clean, minimal Expense Tracker. Lets start with a clear plan before writing any code.

Requirements (Scope)

1. Give me the clear plan of the application.
2. Full REST API with CRUD for expenses (Create, Read, Delete, Update) using Flask and maintain the codebase for REST API in a separate directory.
3. Each expense has: id, title, description, amount, category (e.g., Food/Travel/Utilities/Others), spent on date, created_at (date), updated_at (date).
4. Use PostgreSQL for storage with any well known and widely used ORM that is compatible with Python and Flask.
5. All front-end should be developed using React Native Web + Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React Query, Reanimated 3, Bun, Vercel.
6. REST API, front-end, database should be containerized using Docker.
7. Install the PostgreSQL inside Docker container and make it persistent.
8. Deploy the React Native stack on Vercel.
9. Test the application and make sure it works as expected.
10. Update the README.md file with all the details.
